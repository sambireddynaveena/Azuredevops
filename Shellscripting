Basic shell commands to learn

Create a VM, connect to the server (through terminal) or from the azure portal
login to the VM(linux or windows or ubuntu...)

basic shell commands
>ls  (list all the files from the server)
>man ls (it shows the command information, when we enter man)
>touch examplefile.sh (creates a file)
>vim exapmlefile2.sh(vi or vim command helps to create and open the file)
where we can write up script in the file
after opening

#!bin/bash (shebang)
                 { #!bin/bash or #!bin/sh or #!bin/ksh or #!bin/dash
                     Difference between #!bin/bash  and #!bin/sh  (historically both are same to execute the script from the file, it is to redirect it but now when we use #!bin/sh all the operatin systems scripts are not executing)
-
-
:q! ( it exits from the file)/   :wq!(save and exit the file)

To execute the file 
./examplefile.sh
or
sh examplefile.sh

To print the contents from the file
>cat filename1.sh
>pwd (present working directory)
>cd change directory
>cd.. (back to the previous directory)
>mkdir directoryname(create a new directory)
>chmod 777 filename.sh  ( 4 2 1 ( 4 to read, 2 to write, 1 to execute)) chmod 444 filename...etc
chmod xxx ( first x for permissions to owner, second X for permissions to group, third x for permissions to everyone)

>./filename.sh  or >sh filename.sh ( for execution)

Note: we use shell scripting to check infrastrure maintenance and monitoring, automation, for configuration managment
To check node health ( parameters of CPU, RAM, Diskspace from bulk servers to alert the emails for server health.

>nproc  for listings of CPU's
>Top command for the CPU
>free command for the memory used, using, free
>df  and dnf ( to check disk space)
