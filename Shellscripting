Basic shell commands to learn

Create a VM, connect to the server (through terminal) or from the azure portal
login to the VM(linux or windows or ubuntu...)

basic shell commands
>ls  (list all the files from the server)
>man ls (it shows the command information, when we enter man)
>touch examplefile.sh (creates a file)
>vim exapmlefile2.sh(vi or vim command helps to create and open the file)
where we can write up script in the file
after opening

#!bin/bash (shebang)
                 { #!bin/bash or #!bin/sh or #!bin/ksh or #!bin/dash
                     Difference between #!bin/bash  and #!bin/sh  (historically both are same to execute the script from the file, it is to redirect it but now when we use #!bin/sh all the operatin systems scripts are not executing)
-
-
:q! ( it exits from the file)/   :wq!(save and exit the file)

To execute the file 
./examplefile.sh
or
sh examplefile.sh

To print the contents from the file
>cat filename1.sh
>pwd (present working directory)
>cd change directory
>cd.. (back to the previous directory)

you can write all the scripts inside of the one file
#!bin/bash

set -x ( # debug mode)
set -e ( # exits when an error)
set -o  (pipefail)

(with only set -e  exists when an error, but continuous further, difficult to find out the error, we may miss that) if we dont use set -o

Advantage of set -o, it will fail with the error, stops execution of remaining commands from the script file.


>grep (search the keywords)

> | pipe symbol for it gives output of first command to second command

>awk commad of to get specified columns/specific patterns to get

ex: ./filename.sh |grep naveena |awk "-F" '{print $2}'
o/p:
particular colum prints from the file


we can use if and if else and two if conditions and for loop conditions
from the script

we can write the script for ci/cd pipeline configurations
to restore
>mkdir directoryname(create a new directory)
>chmod 777 filename.sh  ( 4 2 1 ( 4 to read, 2 to write, 1 to execute)) chmod 444 filename...etc
chmod xxx ( first x for permissions to owner, second X for permissions to group, third x for permissions to everyone)

>./filename.sh  or >sh filename.sh ( for execution)

Note: we use shell scripting to check infrastrure maintenance and monitoring, automation, for configuration managment
To check node health ( parameters of CPU, RAM, Diskspace from bulk servers to alert the emails for server health.

>nproc  for listings of CPU's
>Top command for the CPU
>free command for the memory used, using, free
>df  and dnf ( to check disk space)
