Basic shell commands to learn

Create a VM, connect to the server (through terminal) or from the azure portal
login to the VM(linux or windows or ubuntu...)

basic shell commands
>ls  (list all the files from the server)
>man ls (it shows the command information, when we enter man)
>touch examplefile.sh (creates a file)
>vim exapmlefile2.sh(vi or vim command helps to create and open the file)
where we can write up script in the file
after opening

#!bin/bash (shebang)
                 { #!bin/bash or #!bin/sh or #!bin/ksh or #!bin/dash
                     Difference between #!bin/bash  and #!bin/sh  (historically both are same to execute the script from the file, it is to redirect it but now when we use #!bin/sh all the operatin systems scripts are not executing)
-
-
:q! ( it exits from the file)/   :wq!(save and exit the file)

To execute the file 
./examplefile.sh
or
sh examplefile.sh
