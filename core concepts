Monolithic vs Microservices

Monolithic: 
Everything in a single codebase (Single repository)
All the code, frontend and backend, database..all

  Good for small applications and cheap but for longer run, it would be difficult when its growing.
Microservices:
  Breaking down the code into small pieces.
  Cot-effective but for loner run and large applications, it is beneficial
easy to maintain.

  Note: Kubernetes is not a microservice
its a tool to run the microservice application
its a microservice platform.
