1. What is Azure Bastion?
What and why we need to use

Azure Bastion service protects the Remotely connVirtual machine's, it allow us to close the ports for RDP (3389) and SSH (22) through the NSG, so that , 
we can secure the Remote connections of VM much more through Bastion, Much Safer.

Allowing Administrative users to connect Windows and linux virtual machines through remote connection, instead of leaving Port 3389 and 22, we can cloe them. 
much safer to secure the server, by dissociating the Public Ip address

It is Microsoft Azure Paas service
it provides, secure RDP and SSH connections to the VM's withoud needing the Public Ip's.

It itegrated wo the Firewalls and Security permiters.
