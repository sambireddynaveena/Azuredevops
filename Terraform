Terraform: Iac tool ( which uses HCL) hashicorp configuration language or Json to define the infrastructure

*** How Terraform is connecting or calling the cloud service( Azure, Aws, GCp..)***
terraform is a API as a code, internally, through the providers, which we have mentioned in the Tf files, 
which connectes the HCL providers/plugins through the various APIs, it connectes to cloud services. 

For AZure - ARM (json) which Azure resource manager understands
For AWS - cloudformation
For GCP- etc..their own template

Wherever we are using multi cloud configuration, with the above, its difficult to use, so terraform is beneficial for highly available infrastructre.
Competetor of terraform is Crossplane
