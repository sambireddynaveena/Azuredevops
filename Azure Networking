Before Jump into the Networking topics, need to understand, Basic network concepts,

Switches
Routers
Default gateway

1. How the Devices will communicate each other within the same Network ( thorugh Switches)/If its different network/through Router
2. Two Devices within the network has Network Interface, through that, we can add/link IP address to the devices    (commnand >ip link) (> ip addr add 192.162.1.1)
3. Through Switch, we can enable the Network.
4. if its Different Network ---> thats where Routers comein ( it is a intelligent device, its connected to multiple ports for network devices)
5. Router is a Physical server, many Routers on Network,    question is, if there are multiple Routers, how Different networks are communicating
its just a device for particular other network
** Default Gateway**
6. Here Routing is important, Gateway**, We are enabling the routetables and adding the Gate to the Network ( ** door to the Network**)
> route  ---we can check the routing tables assigned over a Network to connect the specified network
>ip route add 192.168.1.10/24 via 192.168.2.0 ( addigng the n/w to another network)

default Gateway 0.0.0.0
we can add other specificed Internal private networks, to enable the communication through Route.
we can troubleshoot issues easily with this.
                      192.168.1.0 n/w                                                                  192.168.2.0 n/w
A N/w--192.168.1.5  -------------------- 192.168.1.6 B Network 192.168.2.6 ( Two Interfaces so Two Ips)------------------C Network 192.168.2.5
If A wants to connect C host, through B N/w, what can be done
Through route tables we need to add
>ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.6
>ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.2.6


>ip link   --list and modify the interfaces on the host
>ip addr ---to see the assigned IP address on host
>ip addr add 192.168.1.0/24 dev etho  --to add ip address to the interface
>route   --list routing table
>ip route --to update the routing tables
>cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward  -----command to check ip_forwarding is enabled or not on a host configured as a router
1

**DNS**
>ping db   ---if we dont assign any domain name to the host, it wont access
to update the Domain name to the ipaddress
>cat >>/etc/hpsts
>ping db









## Need to know, what are the services from Network
Description of those, How these services will interconnect and work together
What are the best possibility ways, to utialize the services

OSI Model: ( open systems interconnection)

7 Layers
1. Application layer - computer-human interactions, where application access the network services
2. Presentation layer - Where Data encryption occures, it ensures the data is in usable format
3. Session Layer - Maintains connections, and is responsible for controlling ports and sessions
4. Transport Layer - transmissing the data over TCP/UDP
5. Network Layer - Decides which physical path data will take
6. Data Link Layer - Decides the format of data in Network
7. Physical Layer - transmits raw data bits stream over the Physical medium

Notes in short-
TCP  (Transmission control protocol) - Direct and orederd commnication with connectection oriented ( Works at Transport layer)
UDP (User Datagram protocol)- Speed and connection less ( works at Transport layer)
IP- Internet protocal - works at network layer - assigning unique IP addresses and maintains Routing tables
It manages addressing and routing the data packets in network

Ports:
Ports are the communication endpoints it enables end to end communication from the devices

20 &21 - File transfer protocol
22 - SSH (secure shell)
23 -  Telnet remote protocol (unsecure)
25 - SMTP ( simple mail transfer protocol)
53 - DNS service protocol
80 - Http (hyper text transfer protocol)
110 - POP3 ( post office protocol)
123 - NTP ( Network TIme protocol)
143 - IMAP ( internet message Access protocol)
161-  SNMP ( Simple network managemnt protocol)
443 - https( Hyper text transfer protocol)

CIDR: Classless inter domain routing

255.x.x.x/n
Formula for number of IP's= 2^32-n
Ex:
 No.of Ips  Prefix  Subnet mask
  1          /32     255.255.255.255
  2          /31     255.255.255.254
  4          /30     255.255.255.252
  8          /29     255.255.255.248

Routing is the process of directing data from Source to destination, Routers use 
routing tables 
protocols
to transmitt the date  and ensuring efficient and reliable communication

DNS:
Domian name system, It translates Domain Names to computer freindly Ips and it helps to find mail servers, it balances web traffic, 
among servers and redirect requests and reverse lookups and speeds up responses through caching

VPN:
Virtual private network
It is secure tunnel, which helps encrypting the data over the public network
while accessing Remote servers and cloud services, without compromising the data security and improve the security

Network Foundation:
Vnet: Private network
which allow us to communicate b/e azure resources
communicate between two virtual networks
Communicate to the internet
communicate with on-premises networks
Encrypt traffic between resources

Ping - To find the reachability of a host in IP  ex: ping google.com
Ipconfig/ifconfig - to find the configuration of a network interfaces ex: ipconfig
nslookup in Windows/Host  in linux) - to query the Domain name system servers for domain information  ex: host google.com
Dig - Domian information groper -TO query the domain name system servers for mail servers and host addreesess  Ex: Dig google.com
Traceroute- To display the route and measure the transit delayes of packets across internet protocol network  ex: Traceroute google.com
Netstat- to disaply the active network connections routing tables
Nmap- To discover the hosts and services over a computer network
TCpdump- To capture and analysis network traffic

NAT Gateway:
Network Address Translation
NAT gateway associated with the subnets ( create NAT gateway, in VPN, goto subnetes, click on it, apply the NAT gateway attach to it)
Whatever the Instances were in in VPN/VPC has the private internet IP address, which translated into the public IP, 
by without exposing oer a internet to avoid potential risks.

// A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service.
You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC 
but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances.

it increases the security
