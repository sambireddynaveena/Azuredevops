## Need to know, what are the services from Network
Description of those, How these services will interconnect and work together
What are the best possibility ways, to utialize the services

## Network Foundation
Vnet, 
Private link
Azure DNS
Azure bastion
Route server
NAT gateway
Traffic manager

## Load balancing and content delivery
Allow for managemnt, Distribution and optimaization of your applications and workloads

Load balancer
Application Gateway
Azure Front Door

## Hybrid connectivity
Secure Communication to and from your resources to Azure
VPN Gateway
Expressroute
Virtual WAN
and peering service

#Network security
protect web applications and Iaas services from DDos attacks and malicious actors

Firewall Manager
Firewall
Web application Firewall
DDos Protection

## Network Managment and monitoring
Azure network managemnt and monitoring services provide tools to manager your network resources

Azure monitor
Network Watcher
Azure Virtual network maanger



OSI Model: ( open systems interconnection)

7 Layers
1. Application layer - computer-human interactions, where application access the network services
2. Presentation layer - Where Data encryption occures, it ensures the data is in usable format
3. Session Layer - Maintains connections, and is responsible for controlling ports and sessions
4. Transport Layer - transmissing the data over TCP/UDP
5. Network Layer - Decides which physical path data will take
6. Data Link Layer - Decides the format of data in Network
7. Physical Layer - transmits raw data bits stream over the Physical medium

Notes in short-
TCP  (Transmission control protocol) - Direct and orederd commnication with connectection oriented ( Works at Transport layer)
UDP (User Datagram protocol)- Speed and connection less ( works at Transport layer)
IP- Internet protocal - works at network layer - assigning unique IP addresses and maintains Routing tables
It manages addressing and routing the data packets in network

Ports:
Ports are the communication endpoints it enables end to end communication from the devices

20 &21 - File transfer protocol
22 - SSH (secure shell)
23 -  Telnet remote protocol (unsecure)
25 - SMTP ( simple mail transfer protocol)
53 - DNS service protocol
80 - Http (hyper text transfer protocol)
110 - POP3 ( post office protocol)
123 - NTP ( Network TIme protocol)
143 - IMAP ( internet message Access protocol)
161-  SNMP ( Simple network managemnt protocol)
443 - https( Hyper text transfer protocol)

CIDR: Classless inter domain routing

255.x.x.x/n
Formula for number of IP's= 2^32-n
Ex:
 No.of Ips  Prefix  Subnet mask
  1          /32     255.255.255.255
  2          /31     255.255.255.254
  4          /30     255.255.255.252
  8          /29     255.255.255.248

Routing is the process of directing data from Source to destination, Routers use 
routing tables 
protocols
to transmitt the date  and ensuring efficient and reliable communication

DNS:
Domian name system, It translates Domain Names to computer freindly Ips and it helps to find mail servers, it balances web traffic, 
among servers and redirect requests and reverse lookups and speeds up responses through caching

VPN:
Virtual private network
It is secure tunnel, which helps encrypting the data over the public network
while accessing Remote servers and cloud services, without compromising the data security and improve the security

Network Foundation:
Vnet: Private network
which allow us to communicate b/e azure resources
communicate between two virtual networks
Communicate to the internet
communicate with on-premises networks
Encrypt traffic between resources
